<h1>About Me Paragraph</h1>
<p>I have experience with both HTML and CSS. I have created older projects for other coding tutorial websites, I can't remember their names at the moment. I enrolled in this class because I wanted to properly learn how to code. I am excited playing with my newfound skills. I will use the lessons that I have learned from this class to later create my very own video games. </p>
