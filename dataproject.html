<h1>Data Project Page</h1>
<p>Problem that I am trying to solve: How does someone make a popular and
successful website?
My target audience is Entrepreneurs/Programmers.
I will solve this problem by looking up website/app reviews online.</p>

<p>The data that I will need to collect: The pro's and con's of the
Google website. The pro's and con's of the YouTube website. The pro's
and con's of the Facebook website.  The pro's and con's of the
Wikipedia website. I collect this information from reviews of these
websites.</p>

<p>Possible problems with my data: The information from these review
websites may not be very accurate or contain truthful information. I
can clean this by looking through personal reviews from actual user's
of these websites from multiple sources.</p>

<p>How the data will be used: The similar pro's of each website will be
compiled together and used to show off what makes a good website. The
similar con's of each website will be compiled together and used to
show off what makes a not so good website.</p>

<p>My opinion on using an automatic algorithm: I am against automating
the prediction/recommendation because I believe that my results would
feel more genuine and interesting if they were completely made by me
and not by an automated algorithm.</p>

<p>All Research:</p>

<p>Google Pro's:It is heavily automated. It is great for students. It has
really quick loading speed.It is very accurate.It is smooth and handy.
It has great aplications. It is very simple and not overly complicated
when it comes to searching. It has a great news feature. It is very
trustworthy. It is has very few bugs and/or glitches.</p>

<p>Google Con's: Very cluttered home screen. Very few user friendly
options. Very few ways to contact the staff. It doesn't have anything
fresh or new. The settings aren't very helpful. It is not very time
efficient overall. The notifications are annoying and glitchy. The
auto update doesn't work all that well. Voice feature isn't very
accurate or useful. It changes way too often.</p>

<p>Youtube Pro's: It has so much interesting and unique content. It has a
very useful video guiding system. It works great with both kids and
adults alike. It is always up to date. It is a very innovative piece
of software.</p>

<p>Youtube Con's: It changes way too often. The layout is very confusing.
It has questionable content at times. It is a lot of inappropriate
comments and content that little kids can easily stumble across.
Youtube is not very supportive of their content creators.</p>

<img src="Youtube Chart.png" alt="YouTubeChart" style="width:860px;height:540px;">  
  
<p>Facebook Pro's: Users are allowed to do whatever they want with
whoever they want, a.k.a they have a lot of freedom. The possibilities
of what people can do on this site are practically endless. It has a
very reliable monitoring service. It is very attractive due to its
many different and unique elements. It has an innovative streaming
system. It is easy to make new friends on this website.</p>

<p>Facebook Con's: It is not a safe place for children. Many users have
created a lot of iffy content. You can easily be cyberbullied on this
website. Digital footprints that people leave on this website can be
easily tracked and monitored. There are some pretty inapropriate
advertisements on this website.</p>

<img src="Facebook Chart.png" alt="FacebookChart" style="width:860px;height:540px;">  
  
<p>Wikipedia Pro's: People can express themselves on topics that they
like. It has some pretty good content guidlines. Anyone can fix any
article that they want. They are litteraly hundreds of different
articles to explore. Almost anyone can relate to this website.</p>

<img src="Wikipedia Chart.png" alt="WikipediaChart" style="width:860px;height:540px;"> 
  
<p>Wikipedia Con's: It has a lot of inappropriate and non kid-friendly
content. The articles can contain false information. There are no
warnings for any adult articles. The guidelines don't go far enough.
Articles can also contain links to adult websites.</p>
     
<p>The answer to my question:  What makes a good website: It has to be
educational in some way, shape, or form. It has to include truthful and accurate
content. It must be kid-friendly. It must have frequent updates. It
must have fast loading times. The layout must be simplistic and nice
to look at. It must have a lot of different and unique content. It
must be bug free.</p>

<p>What makes a not so good website: It is very glitchy and buggy. It has
a lot of inappropriate content. It has a poorly made security system.
The content is inaccurate and misleading. It has slow loading times.
It updates too often. The layout is messy and unappealing. It has very
little interesting content.</p>
